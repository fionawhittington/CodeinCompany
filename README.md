# CodeinCompany
This application helps match women and femme non-binary individuals beginner coders with similar skill levels to build projects and learn how to code together. Learning how to code can be lonely, so I've created this tool to help foster collaboration and community among entry-level designers, developers, and product managers.  

# What does this project do?
This project matches women and femme non-binary individuals together based on their technical skill-level and interests in various technologies. The aim of the tools is to help beginners find each other so that they can learn technical skills by building projects together. I'm hoping to build the application with MEAN Stack to enable users to create a profile and interact with each other. Their profiles as mentioned will have the information they provided about their skill level and projects they want to learn how to build with other beginner coders. 

# Why is this project useful?
This project is useful because otherwise, it is difficult for women beginning to learn how to code to find women with similar interests or ambitions. I'm hoping this will also make women feel more supported and encouraged to pursue their interests in technology. 

# How do I get started?
No requirements for contribution. The development environment has not been set up yet, so more there will be more in this section to come later on in the project. 

# Where can I get more help, if I need it?
